= DataHandler =

The StockData handler classes are the DataHandler-s. There are two types of handlers:
  * data senders: producers of data - *[DataHandler#DataSource DataSource]*
  * data receivers: the consumer of data - *[DataHandler#DataReceiver DataReceiver]*
There is a third type of handlers, the mixture of previous two: the *[DataHandler#DataProcessor DataProcessor]*. It's a receiver which transforms the input data, and generates new one.

== Structure ==
  * *Name* short name of handler
  * *Description* description about handler

= DataSource =
The source of StockDatas. It generates the input information to the application from the outer world (for example a CSV file, a web page, etc.). For test purpose there is a RandomDataSource.
== Structure ==
The source must define its output parameters: the name of instruments, and the type of data.
